## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Stats/ML Major, additional in Computer Science. GitHub profile has various public repos, but most of my code is private because it's code I produced for labs @ CMU and elsewhere. Contact me at ```leoyao@cmu.edu``` for access or other inquiries. Also, my resume is in a public repository here for easy access, if you're interested.
